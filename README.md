# PyNuclearSchottky
Calculator for nuclear schottky anomalies in rare earth ions in python. 
This code calculates a nuclear schottky anomaly in heat capacity from the electronic ordered moment for Pr3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu2+, Gd3+, Tb3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+, and Yb3+ ions. Naturally occuring isotopic compositions are assumed, and hyperfine coupling constants are taken from Bleaney, J. App. Phys., Vol. 34, No. 4 (1963), Table I.

For a theory description and examples of use, please see the tutorial Ipython notebook. A Nuclear Schottky anomaly for any of the above ions can be computed in just three lines of Python code.
